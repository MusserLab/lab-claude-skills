# Introduction Writing Guide

## Structure (3-5 paragraphs typical)

The introduction is a funnel from broad context to specific hypothesis:

### Paragraph 1: The Big Picture
- Establish the broad biological question or phenomenon
- Make it relevant to readers outside your subfield
- End with the conceptual tension or gap

### Paragraph 2: What We Know
- Summarize relevant prior work
- Build toward what remains unknown
- Be selective—cite foundational and recent work, not everything

### Paragraph 3: The Gap
- Explicitly state what is missing
- Why existing approaches haven't resolved it
- Why this matters

### Paragraph 4: Your Approach
- Introduce your system/method
- Why it's suited to address the gap
- Brief preview of what you did

### Paragraph 5: What We Found (optional)
- One-sentence preview of major findings
- Sets up the narrative arc for Results

## Rhetorical Moves

### The Hook
First 1-2 sentences must grab attention. Strategies:
- **Paradox**: "Despite X, Y remains unexplained"
- **Contrast**: "While X is well understood, Y has received little attention"
- **Bold claim**: "X represents a fundamental question in biology"
- **Surprising fact**: "X accounts for Y% of Z, yet..."

### Building Significance
Every paragraph should implicitly answer "So what?" Connect specific observations to broader principles.

### The Pivot
The transition from "what we know" to "what we don't know" is crucial. Make the gap feel urgent and tractable.

**Weak**: "However, little is known about X."
**Strong**: "These studies leave open a central question: how do X cells achieve Y without Z?"

## Common Problems

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too narrow opening | Jumps into system details | Start with the biology, not your organism |
| Literature dump | Paragraph of citations | Synthesize into a narrative |
| Missing gap statement | Reader can't identify the question | Explicit "remains unknown" sentence |
| Weak rationale | "We used X because it's a model" | Explain why X uniquely addresses the gap |
| Premature detail | Methods in the intro | Save for Results/Methods |

## Logic Flow Test

For each paragraph, ask:
1. What is the one main point?
2. Does it follow from the previous paragraph?
3. Does it set up the next paragraph?
4. Is every sentence necessary?

## Tense Guidelines

- **Present tense**: Established facts, general truths ("X is a conserved process")
- **Past tense**: Specific prior studies ("Smith et al. showed that...")
- **Present tense**: Your study's framing ("Here, we address...")

## Citation Strategy

- Cite foundational papers (even if old)
- Cite most recent relevant work (shows you're current)
- Avoid long citation strings—be selective
- Cite reviews for established concepts
- Cite primary literature for specific claims
