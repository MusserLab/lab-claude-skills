## Abstract: Opening Hook

**Excerpt**:
> The evolutionary origin of metazoan cell types such as neurons and muscles is not known.

**Why this works**:
- Opens with a fundamental, unsolved problem in biology
- Uses active, direct language ("is not known")
- Immediately establishes relevance to broad audience (neurons, muscles = universal interest)
- Single sentence that creates tension

**Principle**: Open with the biggest relevant question your work addresses, not with your system.

## Abstract: Results Statement

**Excerpt**:
> Using whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing in a sponge, an animal without nervous system and musculature, we identified 18 distinct cell types. These include nitric oxide–sensitive contractile pinacocytes, amoeboid phagocytes, and secretory neuroid cells that reside in close contact with digestive choanocytes that express scaffolding and receptor proteins.

**Why this works**:
- Specific number (18 cell types) rather than vague "multiple" or "several"
- Explains the system's relevance (lacks nervous system/muscles)
- Lists concrete findings with functional descriptors
- Each cell type named with its key characteristic

**Principle**: Quantify your findings precisely and characterize them functionally, not just descriptively.

## Abstract: Significance Statement

**Excerpt**:
> Our data show a communication system that is organized around sponge digestive chambers, using conserved modules that became incorporated into the pre- and postsynapse in the nervous systems of other animals.

**Why this works**:
- States the conceptual advance, not just the observation
- Connects specific findings to broad evolutionary significance
- Uses confident language ("show" not "suggest")
- Ends with the take-home message about deep conservation

**Principle**: End abstracts by connecting your specific findings to the broadest relevant implication.

## Introduction: First Paragraph (Compressed)

**Excerpt**:
> Sponges represent a basal animal clade that lack neurons, muscles, and gut. They display canals for filter-feeding and waste removal and are composed of three tissues: pinacocytes lining the canals, outer covering, and basal attachment layer; chambers of choanocytes with microvilli for food capture and motile cilia that drive water flow; and an inner mesohyl composed of stem, skeletogenic, and other mesenchymal cells. Despite their simple organization, sponges have genes that are usually expressed in neurons or muscles, including components of the pre- and postsynapse, and perform whole-body contractions that flush the canal system and expel debris. However, cells with integrative signaling functions are yet unknown.

**Why this works**:
- Establishes system and its relevance immediately
- Builds the paradox: simple body plan + complex molecular toolkit
- Clear "however" pivot to the gap
- Final sentence sets up exactly what the paper will address

**Rhetorical moves**:
1. Introduce system with broad relevance (basal animal)
2. Describe key features concisely
3. Create tension (paradox of simplicity + molecular complexity)
4. Pivot to the gap

**Principle**: Use the introduction's first paragraph to establish your system AND the central question in one fluid narrative.

## Results: Section Opening (Narrative-Driven)

**Excerpt**:
> We then generated a cell type tree using neighbor-joining tree reconstruction, which revealed well-supported clades of differentiated cell types robust to bootstrapping and variable gene sets. Major cell type clades included extended pinacocyte and choanocyte families, as well as two families of mesenchymal cells...

**Why this works**:
- Leads with what was found, not what was done
- Includes validation (bootstrap support)
- Immediate biological interpretation (cell type families)
- Sets up further exploration

**Principle**: Start results sections with findings and their interpretation, not methodology.

## Results: Figure Integration

**Excerpt**:
> Field of view recordable on a synchrotron beamline. Registration of the synchrotron tomogram to the full sample block enabled precise trimming and acquisition of higher-resolution FIB-SEM data. We term this method correlative x-ray electron microscopy (CXEM). In these volumes, we observed numerous secretory vesicles 50 to 500 nm in size throughout both neuroid cells, including in the cellular protrusions (Fig. 6D and fig. S28D), and two Golgi stacks per cell...

**Why this works**:
- Integrates figure citations into claims naturally
- Includes specific measurements (50-500 nm)
- Names the method clearly
- Figures support specific claims, not just "see Fig X"

**Principle**: Reference figures as evidence for specific claims, not as stand-alone entities.

## Discussion: Opening Synthesis

**Excerpt**:
> A notable feature of gene and species evolution is a treelike history of common descent. We observed significant hierarchical organization among differentiated cell type expression programs in Spongilla, which was reflected by transcription factors and functional modules that are shared across subclades in the cell type tree. We propose that this reflects evolutionary relatedness rather than homoplasy and that major sponge cell type families, such as endymocytes and peptidocytes, originated via cell type diversification.

**Why this works**:
- Opens with a conceptual frame (tree-like evolution)
- Immediately connects to main finding
- Makes a clear interpretive claim ("We propose")
- Introduces new terminology (endymocytes, peptidocytes) with explanation

**Principle**: Open the Discussion with your central interpretation, not a summary of results.

## Figure Legend: Conclusory Title

**Excerpt**:
> Figure 1. S. lacustris cell types from whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing.

**Note**: This is actually a descriptive title. A conclusory alternative would be:
> Figure 1. Spongilla comprises 18 distinct cell types organized in developmental trajectories from archaeocyte stem cells.

**Principle**: Figure titles should state the conclusion, not just describe what's shown.

## Rhetorical Pattern: The Paradox Hook

This paper repeatedly uses the paradox structure: sponges are "simple" (no neurons, no muscles) yet have complex molecular machinery. This creates immediate interest because readers want to know how the paradox resolves.

**Application**: Identify the paradox in your own data — what seems surprising or contradictory? Lead with that tension.
