# Prose Craft: Sentence-Level Style

Concise, punchy writing with strategic use of rhetoric.

## The Economy Principle

Every word must earn its place. High-impact prose is dense with meaning.

### Word Economy Examples

**Bloated**: "It is important to note that the evolutionary origin of metazoan cell types such as neurons and muscles has not yet been fully elucidated by the scientific community."

**Lean**: "The evolutionary origin of metazoan cell types such as neurons and muscles is not known."

The lean version:
- Cuts "It is important to note that" (adds nothing)
- Cuts "fully elucidated by the scientific community" (pretentious, vague)
- Uses "is not known" (direct, confident)

### The Verb Test

Strong verbs carry more meaning than weak verb + adverb combinations.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| is indicative of | indicates |
| plays a role in | regulates / drives / mediates |
| is involved in | participates in / controls |
| was found to be | was / showed |
| appears to suggest | suggests |

**Example transformation**:
- Before: "This gene appears to play an important role in the regulation of contractility"
- After: "This gene regulates contractility"

## Sentence Architecture

### The Front-Loaded Sentence

Put the main point at the beginning, not the end.

**Back-loaded** (weak): "Through the use of whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing in a sponge, an animal without nervous system and musculature, we were able to identify 18 distinct cell types."

**Front-loaded** (strong): "We identified 18 distinct cell types using whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing in a sponge, an animal without nervous system and musculature."

The finding ("18 distinct cell types") comes first; the method comes second.

### The Power Position

The end of a sentence has emphasis. Place important information there.

**Weak ending**: "These observations suggested that S. lacustris deflation is initiated by a reduction of actomyosin crossbridge cycling through MLCP activation, we found."

**Strong ending**: "These observations strongly suggested that S. lacustris deflation is initiated by a reduction of actomyosin crossbridge cycling through MLCP activation, which equals actomyosin relaxation."

"Actomyosin relaxation" lands with impact because it's the new concept.

### Sentence Length Variation

Monotonous rhythm kills prose. Vary sentence length strategically.

**Monotonous**:
> "We found 18 cell types. These included pinacocytes. Pinacocytes are contractile. They also include choanocytes. Choanocytes are digestive."

**Varied**:
> "We found 18 cell types. These included nitric oxide–sensitive contractile pinacocytes, amoeboid phagocytes, and secretory neuroid cells that reside in close contact with digestive choanocytes that express scaffolding and receptor proteins."

The second version: one short declarative, then one long sentence with parallel structure.

## Strategic Adjectives

Adjectives in scientific writing should be:
1. **Precise** (not vague intensifiers)
2. **Informative** (add real meaning)
3. **Rare** (used sparingly for impact)

### Adjectives to Avoid

| Vague | Why it fails |
|-------|--------------|
| very | Adds no precision |
| highly | What's the threshold? |
| extremely | Hyperbole without data |
| quite | Hedging disguised as emphasis |
| really | Conversational filler |
| significant | Statistical or casual? Be specific |

### Adjectives That Work

**Functional adjectives** add real information:
- "nitric oxide–sensitive contractile pinacocytes" — tells you the phenotype
- "motile cilia" — distinguishes from primary cilia
- "isometric relaxation" — specific biomechanical term

**Quantitative adjectives** are precise:
- "18 distinct cell types" — not "many" or "numerous"
- "near total loss (~96%)" — not "dramatic reduction"

### The One-Adjective Rule

When tempted to stack adjectives, choose the most important one.

**Stacked** (weak): "a novel, important, highly conserved pathway"
**Chosen** (strong): "a conserved pathway" (conservation IS the point)

## Rhetorical Flourishes: When and How

Flourishes are high-risk, high-reward. Use them at:
- Paper opening
- Key conceptual points
- Paper closing

### The Paradox Flourish

> "Sponges represent a basal animal clade that lack neurons, muscles, and gut... Despite their simple organization, sponges have genes that are usually expressed in neurons or muscles."

The "Despite" creates productive tension.

### The Pivot Flourish

> "Yet the exact cellular processes and physiological changes driving and accompanying these processes have largely remained obscure."

"Yet" signals the turn. "Largely remained obscure" has slight gravity without being purple.

### The Naming Flourish

> "We term this method correlative x-ray electron microscopy (CXEM)."
> "We propose that this reflects evolutionary relatedness rather than homoplasy."

Giving names to concepts is a subtle form of emphasis—it signals importance.

### The Final Flourish

> "The conservation of this relaxant-inflammatory module suggests an ancient response against disturbances in normal, laminar flow as part of metazoan epithelia."

"Ancient response" is a small flourish. "Metazoan epithelia" broadens the scope. The sentence has weight without being overwrought.

### Flourishes to Avoid

- **Throat-clearing**: "It is well known that..." / "Importantly,..."
- **False modesty**: "We humbly suggest..." / "We tentatively propose..."
- **Hyperbole**: "groundbreaking" / "revolutionary" / "paradigm-shifting"
- **Clichés**: "Holy grail" / "tip of the iceberg" / "double-edged sword"

## Parallel Structure

Parallel construction creates rhythm and clarity.

### Within Sentences

**Not parallel**: "Sponges display canals for filter-feeding, removing waste, and they attach to substrates."

**Parallel**: "Sponges display canals for filter-feeding and waste removal."

### Across Lists

**Not parallel**:
- Identify cell types
- We characterized gene expression
- The morphology was analyzed

**Parallel**:
- Identify cell types
- Characterize gene expression
- Analyze morphology

### In Section Headings

**Not parallel**:
- "OCM reveals unchanged surfaces"
- "Triggering tension release with pharmacology"
- "Active pumping during relaxation"

**Parallel**:
- "OCM reveals unchanged surfaces during deflation"
- "An Akt/NO/PKG/PKA pathway triggers tension release"
- "Active pumping continues during actomyosin relaxation"

## Active vs. Passive Voice

### Default to Active

**Passive**: "It was found that pinacocytes express contractile genes."
**Active**: "We found that pinacocytes express contractile genes."
**Better active**: "Pinacocytes express contractile genes."

### When Passive Works

Use passive when:
1. The agent is obvious or irrelevant: "Samples were incubated overnight."
2. You want to emphasize the object: "18 cell types were identified."
3. Methods sections (conventional): "RNA was extracted using TRIzol."

## Hedging: Strategic Uncertainty

### Appropriate Hedges

Use hedging for:
- Speculation beyond your data: "This may suggest..."
- Interpretation: "These data are consistent with..."
- Claims that need future validation: "...potentially indicating..."

### Over-Hedging

**Over-hedged**: "These results may potentially suggest that it is possible that X might play some role in Y."

**Appropriately hedged**: "These results suggest X plays a role in Y."

### The Confidence Gradient

| Confidence | Language |
|------------|----------|
| High | "X shows / demonstrates / establishes" |
| Medium | "X suggests / indicates / supports" |
| Low | "X is consistent with / may reflect" |
| Speculative | "X raises the possibility that" |

## Cutting Exercises

Practice cutting these common bloat patterns:

| Bloated | Cut |
|---------|-----|
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |
| "At the present time" | "Currently" or "Now" |
| "In the event that" | "If" |
| "A large number of" | "Many" |
| "Is able to" | "Can" |
| "It is interesting to note that" | [delete entirely] |
| "The question as to whether" | "Whether" |
| "In light of the fact that" | "Given" or "Since" |
| "Has the ability to" | "Can" |

## The Read-Aloud Test

Final sentences should sound good when read aloud. If you stumble, the reader will too.

**Clunky**: "The identification of the conservation of such a relaxant-inflammatory module's presence suggests..."

**Smooth**: "The conservation of this relaxant-inflammatory module suggests..."

Read your key sentences aloud. Cut until they flow.
