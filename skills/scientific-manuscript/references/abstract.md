# Abstract Writing Guide

## Structure (150-300 words typical)

High-impact abstracts follow a compressed narrative arc:

1. **Context** (1-2 sentences): Establish the field and knowledge gap
2. **Objective** (1 sentence): What this study addresses
3. **Approach** (1-2 sentences): Key methods or system
4. **Results** (2-4 sentences): Major findings with specific data
5. **Significance** (1-2 sentences): Why this matters broadly

## Principles

### Lead with Impact
Open with the broadest relevant context, then quickly narrow to your contribution. Avoid throat-clearing ("X is important because...").

**Weak**: "Cell type evolution is a fundamental question in biology."
**Strong**: "How novel cell types arise remains poorly understood despite their role in animal diversification."

### Be Quantitatively Specific
Replace vague claims with concrete findings.

**Weak**: "We found significant differences in gene expression."
**Strong**: "We identified 847 genes with >4-fold expression changes between contractile and non-contractile states."

### End with Broad Significance
The final sentence should resonate beyond your specific system.

**Weak**: "These findings advance our understanding of sponge biology."
**Strong**: "The conservation of this relaxant-inflammatory module suggests an ancient epithelial response predating nervous systems."

## Common Problems

| Problem | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Burying the lead | Starting with methods | Lead with the discovery |
| Vague results | "We characterized X" | State what you found |
| Missing significance | Ending with results | Add "these findings suggest..." |
| Jargon overload | Undefined technical terms | Define or replace with accessible language |
| Passive voice | "It was observed that" | "We observed" or "X showed" |

## Journal-Specific Notes

**Nature/Science**: Emphasize conceptual advance and broad relevance. Avoid specialist jargon.
**Cell**: Can be more mechanistically detailed. Highlight molecular insights.
**Current Biology**: Balance accessibility with technical precision. Strong conceptual framing.
