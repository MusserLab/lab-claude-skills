# Narrative Structure and Momentum

How to build a compelling arc across sections and paragraphs.

## The Macro-Arc: Whole-Paper Narrative

High-impact papers follow a tension-resolution structure:

```
TENSION          →    INVESTIGATION    →    RESOLUTION + NEW HORIZON
(Gap/Paradox)         (Your work)           (Answer + implications)
```

### The Tension-Building Opening

The best papers establish tension in the first paragraph. Three patterns:

**1. The Paradox**
> "Sponges represent a basal animal clade that lack neurons, muscles, and gut... Despite their simple organization, sponges have genes that are usually expressed in neurons or muscles."
— Musser et al. 2021

The reader thinks: "How can that be?" and keeps reading.

**2. The Unsolved Problem**
> "The evolutionary origin of metazoan cell types such as neurons and muscles is not known."
— Musser et al. 2021

Direct, confident statement of ignorance. Creates urgency.

**3. The Capability Gap**
> "Comparing single-cell transcriptomic atlases from diverse organisms can elucidate the origins of cellular diversity... Yet, comparison between distant relatives is hindered by complex gene histories."
— Tarashansky et al. 2021

Promise followed by obstacle. Reader wants the solution.

### The Pivot Point

Every strong introduction has a clear pivot from "what we know" to "what we don't know." This is the fulcrum of the narrative.

**Weak pivot**: "However, little is known about X."
**Strong pivot**: "Yet the exact cellular processes and physiological changes driving and accompanying these processes have largely remained obscure." (Ruperti et al. 2024)

The strong pivot is specific about WHAT is unknown.

## Paragraph-Level Architecture

Each paragraph should have internal momentum. The OARC structure:

**O**pening claim (topic sentence)
**A**mplification (evidence/detail)
**R**einforcement (additional support)
**C**losure (implication or transition)

### Example: A Well-Constructed Paragraph

> **[O]** "Sponges represent a basal animal clade that lack neurons, muscles, and gut." **[A]** "They display canals for filter-feeding and waste removal and are composed of three tissues: pinacocytes lining the canals, outer covering, and basal attachment layer; chambers of choanocytes with microvilli for food capture and motile cilia that drive water flow; and an inner mesohyl composed of stem, skeletogenic, and other mesenchymal cells." **[R]** "Despite their simple organization, sponges have genes that are usually expressed in neurons or muscles, including components of the pre- and postsynapse, and perform whole-body contractions that flush the canal system and expel debris." **[C]** "However, cells with integrative signaling functions are yet unknown."

**Note**: The Opening establishes the system. Amplification provides necessary detail. Reinforcement introduces the paradox. Closure pivots to the gap. Every sentence earns its place.

## Section-to-Section Flow

### The Results Cascade

Results sections should cascade—each finding raises a question answered by the next section.

**Pattern from Ruperti et al. 2024:**
1. "OCM reveals unchanged or expanding epithelial surfaces during sponge deflation" → But what drives this?
2. "An Akt kinase/NO/PKG/PKA pathway triggers tension release" → Molecular mechanism
3. "Active pumping continues during actomyosin relaxation" → Resolves apparent contradiction
4. "Quantitative phosphoproteomics and TPP identify..." → Independent validation

Each section heading promises something the reader now wants to know.

### The Discussion Mirror

The Discussion should mirror the Introduction's arc in reverse:

| Introduction | Discussion |
|--------------|------------|
| Broad context | Return to broad context |
| Prior work | How your work relates to prior work |
| Gap | Gap now filled |
| Your approach | What you found |
| (Preview findings) | Broader implications |

## Building Momentum Within Sections

### The Accumulation Pattern

Build evidence in waves, each stronger than the last:

> "Corroborating this, pinacocytes express genes involved in smooth and non-muscle actomyosin contractility and contain actin stress fibers that traverse the cytoplasm, connecting neighboring cells via mixed focal adhesion/adherens-like junctions. Treatment with selected pharmacological compounds has indicated involvement of myosin light-chain kinase (MYLK), cGMP, and nitric oxide (NO) signaling."

First wave: gene expression. Second wave: structural evidence. Third wave: functional evidence.

### The Pivot-and-Extend Pattern

State a finding, then immediately extend it:

> "We observed significant hierarchical organization among differentiated cell type expression programs in Spongilla, **which was reflected by** transcription factors and functional modules that are shared across subclades in the cell type tree."

The "which was reflected by" extends the observation into mechanism.

### The Anticipation Pattern

Plant a question, then answer it:

> "A notable feature of gene and species evolution is a treelike history of common descent. **We observed** significant hierarchical organization among differentiated cell type expression programs..."

The opening creates expectation; "We observed" delivers.

## Controlling Pace

### When to Accelerate

Use short sentences for impact:
- Key findings
- Conclusions
- Surprising results

> "The deflation of the sponge body does not involve cellular-level actomyosin contraction. Instead, it is driven by the simultaneous isometric relaxation of both incurrent and excurrent pinacocytes from a default tense state."

First sentence: negation (short). Second sentence: positive finding (longer, delivers the goods).

### When to Decelerate

Use longer, complex sentences for:
- Building context
- Describing methodology
- Listing related findings

> "SAMap iterates between two modules: the first module constructs a gene-gene bipartite graph with cross-species edges connecting homologous gene pairs, initially weighted by protein sequence similarity; in the second module, SAMap uses the gene-gene graph to project the two single-cell transcriptomic datasets into a joint, lower-dimensional manifold representation."

This slower pace is appropriate for technical exposition.

## Signposting Without Clutter

Good papers guide readers without heavy-handed transitions.

**Avoid**: "Next, we investigated..." / "We then asked..." / "Having established X, we turned to Y"

**Prefer**: Section headings that state findings, followed by paragraphs that begin with claims:

> **Heading**: "An Akt kinase/NO/PKG/PKA pathway triggers tension release in epithelial stress fibers"
>
> **First sentence**: "To explore the molecular mechanisms of deflation, we investigated pathways regulating actomyosin contractility in the pinacocytes."

The heading tells you WHERE you're going. The sentence tells you HOW you got there. No need for "Next, we..."

---

## The Final Sentence

The last sentence of your paper should be memorable and quotable. It returns to the broad context opened in the Introduction.

**Pattern 1: The Deep Time Claim**
> "The conservation of this relaxant-inflammatory module suggests an ancient response against disturbances in normal, laminar flow as part of metazoan epithelia."

**Pattern 2: The Unifying Principle**
> "Our data show a communication system that is organized around sponge digestive chambers, using conserved modules that became incorporated into the pre- and postsynapse in the nervous systems of other animals."

**Pattern 3: The Future Horizon**
> "We expect the tools presented here to be transferable to EM volumes of other animals with some degree of developmental stereotypy, enabling the comparison of multimodal cell type catalogs across organisms."

All three patterns: specific finding → broad implication.
