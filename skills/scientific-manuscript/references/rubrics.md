# Evaluation Rubrics

Use these rubrics to systematically evaluate manuscript sections. Score each criterion 1-5:
- **5**: Excellent, publication-ready
- **4**: Good, minor improvements needed
- **3**: Adequate, notable improvements needed
- **2**: Weak, significant revision required
- **1**: Poor, fundamental rethinking required

## Abstract Rubric

| Criterion | 5 (Excellent) | 3 (Adequate) | 1 (Poor) |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| **Opening hook** | Immediately engaging, establishes broad relevance | Functional but generic | Buries the lead or too narrow |
| **Gap statement** | Clear, specific knowledge gap | Vague "little is known" | Missing or unclear |
| **Results specificity** | Concrete findings with numbers | General findings stated | Vague or missing results |
| **Significance** | Broad implications clearly stated | Narrow significance | Missing or overstated |
| **Clarity** | Accessible to non-specialists | Some jargon barriers | Dense or confusing |
| **Completeness** | All key findings represented | Missing some findings | Major omissions |

**Weighting**: Opening (15%), Gap (15%), Results (30%), Significance (20%), Clarity (10%), Completeness (10%)

## Introduction Rubric

| Criterion | 5 (Excellent) | 3 (Adequate) | 1 (Poor) |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| **Hook/Opening** | Compelling, establishes broad relevance | Functional context | Generic or too narrow |
| **Literature synthesis** | Narrative builds toward gap | Lists relevant work | Disconnected citations |
| **Gap articulation** | Specific, urgent, tractable | General "unknown" statement | Missing or vague |
| **Rationale** | Clear why this approach addresses gap | Some justification | Missing rationale |
| **Logical flow** | Each paragraph builds on previous | Some awkward transitions | Disconnected paragraphs |

| **Quantitative rigor** | Specific numbers, appropriate statistics | Some quantification | Vague or missing stats |
| **Figure integration** | Figures support claims naturally | Figures referenced but not integrated | Figure walk-through style |

## Using the Rubrics

### For Comprehensive Review
1. Score each section independently
2. Calculate weighted scores
3. Identify lowest-scoring criteria
4. Prioritize improvements by impact × effort

### For Targeted Feedback
1. Identify section of concern
2. Score relevant rubric
3. Focus feedback on criteria scoring < 4
4. Provide specific suggestions for improvement

### For Submission Readiness
- All criteria should score ≥ 4 for submission
- Scores of 3 need attention before submission
- Scores ≤ 2 indicate major revision needed
